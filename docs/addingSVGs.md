# Adding SVGs

SVGs are hard-coded into the problem so that they appear in the database with the rest of the problem. A few notes:

1. Use Optimised SVGs
   In Inkscape a lot of the unnecessary metadata can be stripped by saving as `optimised svg`.
   Options to change include:

   - remove meta (may require `stip xlm:space` override)
   - remove whitespace
   - remove comments
   - remove xml declaration
   - collapse groups

2. Convert text to Vector
   In Inkscape this can be done via `Path -> Object to Path`
