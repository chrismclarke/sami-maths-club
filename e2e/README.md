E2E comes out of the box with protractor + jasmine, however not used very well.

Instead an additional configuration has been built on top of cypress.

The older test spec has been kept for reference (and possible future unit tests)

Folder structure: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Folder-Structure

Master config available in root project cypress.json
